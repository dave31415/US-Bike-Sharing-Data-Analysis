# US-Bike-Sharing-Analysis

In this project, I am using data provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It is an interactive streamlit data app that allows you to compare usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

This data app runs with streamlit on Python 3.8. 

To install

source install.sh

That will activate the virtual environment. If you open another shell you can 
reactivate (without reinstalling) it with

source venv/bin/activate

You can start the app on a localhost using: `./run_app.sh`
